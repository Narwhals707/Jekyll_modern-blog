    <td>We learned much the same way as the last 4 weeks; we got the FUZE Boxes out, set them up and started to make our way through the booklet. We had limited time this week, so our target might've been slightly lower, except Section 3 was shorter than the rest. This still meant that we had to work quickly, so Nick would read the text, while I typed it (with the other information in between).</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We had much less time this week as we were introduced to another bit of homework - making 2 improvements to our blog each week. This meant that we could not complete as much as we would’ve liked to, as many people were asking futile questions, like "Is this homework for every week?".</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, the only thing to change would be to get set up quicker so we had slightly more time to get our work done, though this wouldn’t make a major difference. It will probably be easier to name files more relevant things, and Nick could possibly clear some things off his memory stick (supposing they’re unnecessary anymore).</td>
